**Aura Rocket MT4** is a trend-focused forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This code is a sample implementation of the trading strategy used by the Aura Rocket MT4 robot.

## Installation

To use this code, you need to have the MetaTrader 4 platform installed. Follow these steps to install the Aura Rocket MT4 robot:

1. Download the Aura Rocket MT4 robot from the official developer's site [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com/forex-robot-review/aura-rocket-mt4-review-trend-focused-forex-software/).
2. Install the Aura Rocket MT4 robot by following the installation instructions provided by the official developer.

## Usage

Once the Aura Rocket MT4 robot is installed, it will automatically execute trading operations based on the implemented strategy. The robot uses a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to calculate entry points in the market. It opens trades in the direction of the trend, with specified lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.

## Strategy Overview

The Aura Rocket MT4 robot follows a trend-focused trading strategy. It uses a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to predict entry points in the market. The MLP is trained using historical data to identify potential trends. The robot opens trades in the direction of the predicted trend, with predefined lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.

## Code Explanation

The code is written in MQL5 language, specifically designed for the MetaTrader 4 platform. Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

1. Include necessary libraries:
   - `MLP.mqh` - a library for implementing multilayer perceptron.
   - `Trend.mqh` - a library for trend analysis.

2. Define constants:
   - `LOT_SIZE` - the standard lot size for trading.
   - `STOP_LOSS` - the stop loss level in points.
   - `TAKE_PROFIT` - the take profit level in points.

3. Define global variables:
   - `lotSize` - the current lot size.
   - `stopLoss` - the current stop loss level.
   - `takeProfit` - the current take profit level.

4. Initialize the trading robot:
   - In the `OnInit` function, set the initial lot size, stop loss, and take profit.

5. Execute trading operations:
   - In the `OnTick` function, calculate the entry point using the `CalculateEntryPoint` function.
   - If the entry point is valid, open a trade in the direction of the trend using the `Buy` or `Sell` functions.

6. Calculate entry points using multilayer perceptron:
   - In the `CalculateEntryPoint` function, create and train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) using the `CMLP` class.
   - Get the prediction from the MLP and return it as the entry point.

7. Open a buy trade:
   - In the `Buy` function, place a buy trade with the specified parameters.

8. Open a sell trade:
   - In the `Sell` function, place a sell trade with the specified parameters.
